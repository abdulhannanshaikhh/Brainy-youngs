The Window-Based Quiz Application is a Java project developed using the AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and Swing libraries. This application provides a user-friendly graphical interface for conducting quiz. With a focus on simplicity and ease of use, the application allows users to take in quiz.

The core objective of this project is to design and implement a user-friendly quiz application that leverages the capabilities of AWT and Swing to create an intuitive and efficient interface. The application seeks to achieve the following objectives:
- Enhanced Learning Experience
- Ease of Use
- Educational Tool
- Score Tracking

Key Features:
- Interactive User Interface
- Question Management
- Score Tracking
- Time Limit

Requirements:

Java Development Kit (JDK)
AWT and Swing Libraries

AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and Swing in Java:
AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and Swing are two sets of Java libraries that provide the foundation for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Java applications. Both AWT and Swing offer a collection of classes and components to design and build interactive windows, dialogs, buttons, menus, and other GUI elements. However, Swing is an extended and more modern toolkit that builds upon AWT's foundation, offering enhanced features and greater flexibility.

AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit):
AWT was the original GUI toolkit for Java and is part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC). It provides a set of components that map directly to the native GUI components of the underlying operating system. While AWT is simple and integrates with the native system's look and feel, it has some limitations and lacks certain advanced features compared to modern toolkits.

Swing:
Swing, also part of JFC, was introduced as an evolution of AWT to overcome its limitations. Swing components are implemented entirely in Java and do not rely on native GUI components. This approach allows for greater consistency across different platforms and a higher degree of customization.
